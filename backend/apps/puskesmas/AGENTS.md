# puskesmas AGENTS.md

App-specific guidance for Puskesmas facility workflows.

## Purpose

`puskesmas` owns ad-hoc requests from Puskesmas, receipt-confirmation input for goods actually received from Instalasi Farmasi, facility-scoped subunit master data (`ruang tindakan` / `Pustu`), monthly detailed consumption input, and a Puskesmas-operator-only read-only stock self-check page.

## Facility Scope

- All operational and report-facing surfaces require a linked `user.facility` for every non-superuser account and enforce same-facility object access.
- `OPERATOR PUSKESMAS` users must never read or write another facility's documents.
- Puskesmas report routes require `reports.view_reports` or REPORTS module-scope `VIEW`.
- Superusers may query all facilities in reports; non-superusers are forced to their linked `facility` and receive `403` when no facility is linked.

## Stock Self-Check

- The stock self-check page is LPLPO-only.
- It uses the latest non-rejected LPLPO for the logged-in facility.
- It compares `stock_keseluruhan` (digital stock) with `stock_gudang_puskesmas` (physical stock recorded on that LPLPO).
- It does not apply post-LPLPO receipt or consumption adjustments.
- It does not mutate stock.

## Receipt Confirmations

- Puskesmas `Riwayat Penerimaan` is sourced from `PuskesmasReceiptConfirmation` and `PuskesmasReceiptConfirmationItem`.
- Linked receipt-confirmation create/edit uses a fixed checklist sourced from `DistributionItem` rows.
- Operators can save an incomplete document as `DRAFT` when goods are still missing.
- Operators may only finalize with `CONFIRMED` once every source row is checked as physically received.
- Only `CONFIRMED` receipt confirmations contribute to LPLPO `penerimaan` and weighted `harga_satuan`.
- Legacy migrated receipt-confirmation rows may have null `distribution` / `distribution_item` links and must remain editable through the compatibility edit path with manual row editing.
- New operational receipts still require distribution linkage.
- Create/edit/delete saves are POST-limited by `PUSKESMAS_RECEIPT_CONFIRMATION_MUTATION_RATE_LIMIT`; the create-form distribution preview is non-mutating `GET` and must not consume that quota.

## LPLPO Sync From Receipts

- Saving, editing, or deleting a receipt confirmation atomically re-syncs only same-month editable LPLPO rows in `DRAFT` or `REJECTED_PUSKESMAS`.
- Opening or re-saving an editable LPLPO refreshes same-month `penerimaan` and weighted `harga_satuan` from existing confirmed receipt-confirmation data so older drafts do not keep stale receiving values.
- Once a facility-month LPLPO is `SUBMITTED` or beyond, receipt-confirmation mutation for that period is blocked.

## Detailed Consumption

- Detailed consumption is sourced from `PuskesmasConsumption` and `PuskesmasConsumptionEntry`.
- Consumption is stored separately per facility/month and per facility-defined subunit.
- The sum of `PuskesmasConsumptionEntry.quantity` per item is the editable-period source of truth for `LPLPOItem.pemakaian`.
- Saving, editing, or deleting detailed consumption atomically re-syncs only same-month editable LPLPO rows in `DRAFT` or `REJECTED_PUSKESMAS`.
- Opening or re-saving an editable LPLPO refreshes same-month `pemakaian` values when a detailed-consumption document already exists.
- Once a facility-month LPLPO is `SUBMITTED` or beyond, detailed consumption mutation for that period is blocked.
- Mutation saves are POST-limited by `PUSKESMAS_CONSUMPTION_MUTATION_RATE_LIMIT`.
